## Description
Bevy, the future powerhouse game engine that will power many games.
Today I break down the core philosophy of this game engine, and outline why the engines core philosophies are so powerful, that will truly shine among the game industry's adopted game engine standards (Unity, Unreal, Godot, GameMaker etc...).

Bevy is powered by the Rust programming language, this yield many advantages. The data driven entity component system, is one of the most ergonomic one in existence, simple but powerful.
it enables blazingly fast parallelized game code that can be easily structured and scheduled with absolutely no multithreading knowledge.
3D, and 2D rendering capabilities are solid, but it do not have the drag and drop AAA graphics Unity and Unreal.
Bevy does not currently have a graphical editor, to gain wide adoption this must be available, an editor is currently in the works so we'll hopefully see one within one or two years.

Bevy is free and open source, has a strong community, the future looks bright!
