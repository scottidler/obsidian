## Description
Rust can be frustrating to learn even for developers with years of experience in a language such as Java, JavaScript, or C++. But most of the friction in learning Rust comes from a few core concepts that don't really exist in any other language. These concepts are what gives Rust an edge over other languages. Once they are understood, the Rust journey becomes a lot easier. Moreover, these concepts aren't hard to understand when they are presented using the simplest example possible.
