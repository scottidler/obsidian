## Description
In this blog post, we walk through building an example app with Rust, Axum, and HTMX. Rust is a modern, safe, and fast programming language that is increasingly being used for web development. Axum is a Rust web framework that is both ergonomic and powerful for creating web applications. HTMX is a library that allows you to create dynamic web pages with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The combination of Rust, Axum, and HTMX offers a simple and efficient way to build web applications without the need for traditional JavaScript frameworks. This post highlights the ease and power of this tech stack for web development.
