# Atomic Habits



### Atomic Habits - Key Concepts Summary

#### The Four Laws of Behavior Change

- **Make It Obvious**: Increase the visibility of good habits.
- **Make It Attractive**: Make the habits you want to adopt more appealing.
- **Make It Easy**: Reduce the effort needed to perform good habits.
- **Make It Satisfying**: Ensure your good habits are immediately rewarding.

#### Habit Stacking

- Link a new habit to an existing routine (e.g., `After I brush my teeth, I will meditate for one minute`).

#### The Two-Minute Rule

- Scale down new habits to two-minute versions to make them easy to start (e.g., `Read before bed` becomes `Read one page`).

#### Environment Design

- Shape your environment to make good habits easier and bad habits harder (e.g., have fruits visible and accessible, keep sweets out of sight).

#### The Compound Effect of Small Habits

- Small changes can compound over time, leading to significant outcomes.

#### Identity-Based Habits

- Focus on who you wish to become, not what you want to achieve (e.g., `Become a reader` instead of `Read 20 books a year`).

#### The Importance of Reflection and Review

- Regularly review and reflect on your habits and their alignment with your goals and identity.

#### The Goldilocks Rule

- Stay motivated by working on tasks that are neither too hard nor too easy, but just right.

#### The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Habits

- Your social environment influences your habits, so choose associations that foster positive habits.

#### Tracking Your Habits

- Keep track of your habits, as this can be a motivator and provide insight into your behavior patterns.
