## Description
Dairy Queen's StarKiss treats have sparked confusion among fans as they seemingly disappeared from some locations. However, recent investigations reveal that the treats are not discontinued but are only available at select Dairy Queen locations, especially around the Fourth of July. To the delight of many, these star-shaped frozen treats are making a return, but customers should check with their local Dairy Queen to confirm availability. The limited-time nature of the StarKiss treats adds to their allure, prompting fans to seek them out whenever they pop up at participating stores.
