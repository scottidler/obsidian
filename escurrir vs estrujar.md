# escurrir vs estrujar

"Escurrir" and "estrujar" are both Spanish verbs, but they have different meanings and are used in different contexts.

1. **Escurrir**: This verb means "to drain" or "to let drip dry." It is often used in the context of removing excess liquid from something, like after washing vegetables or clothes. For example, after rinsing lettuce, you might "escurrir" it to get rid of the extra water. It implies a gentler action, where gravity plays a major role in removing the liquid.
    
2. **Estrujar**: This verb means "to wring out" or "to squeeze." It's a more active and forceful action compared to "escurrir." You would "estrujar" a cloth or a sponge to forcefully remove the liquid from it. It involves applying pressure to extract liquid, and it's more about manual effort.
    

In summary, "escurrir" is about letting liquid drain away, often passively, while "estrujar" is about actively squeezing or wringing something to remove liquid.
