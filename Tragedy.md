# Tragedy

The “Tragedy” plot is the reverse of the “Comedy.” The protagonist moves from a generally positive or successful point to one of failure or loss, suffering increasing hardships because of their decisions before their ultimate demise.

Famous tragedies include:

- Shakespeare’s _Romeo and Juliet_
- Oscar Wilde’s _The Picture of Dorian Gray_

While this plot relies on a central mistake or [character flaw](https://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-common-character-flaws-in-literature.html), it’s important to remember that the protagonist of a tragedy doesn’t necessarily have to be unlikable. In fact, a protagonist that the reader can relate to is more likely to evoke the emotional response that tragedies rely on. 

It’s also crucial that the characters are provided with a way out of the impending tragedy, yet choose not to take it. 

If your client hasn’t written any potential escape routes for their characters, the impact of the tragedy is lessened, as it becomes less about the choices characters make and more about the inevitable consequences.
