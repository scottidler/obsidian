# reavivar vs revivir

In Spanish, "reavivar" and "revivir" are two distinct verbs with related but different meanings:

1. "Reavivar":
    
    - Definition: "Reavivar" means to rekindle, revive, or reignite something that has diminished or faded. It often implies bringing back a quality, feeling, or state that was once present but had diminished over time.
    - Example sentence: "Decidieron reavivar su relación después de un tiempo separados" (They decided to rekindle their relationship after some time apart).
2. "Revivir":
    
    - Definition: "Revivir" means to come back to life, to be resurrected, or to experience a return from death. It is used when referring to living beings or, in a more figurative sense, to the revival of something that had ceased to exist.
    - Example sentence: "Milagrosamente, el paciente logró revivir después de estar clínicamente muerto durante varios minutos" (Miraculously, the patient managed to come back to life after being clinically dead for several minutes).

In summary, "reavivar" is about reviving or rekindling something that has faded, while "revivir" is about coming back to life or experiencing a return from death. The choice between these verbs depends on the specific context and the meaning you want to convey.
