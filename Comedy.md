# Comedy

The term “Comedy” here refers to a story that’s not only humorous, but that also follows a specific structure. 

Characters in this plot experience a series of increasingly bizarre events, mistakes, or problems. Then, at last, the misunderstandings of the story are resolved in one final clarifying moment. In Shakespeare’s _A Comedy of Errors_, for example, the characters learn that recent strange events were caused by the presence of two sets of twins in their midst.

Shakespeare produced many of the classic “Comedy” stories, but others include:

- Helen Fielding’s _Bridget Jones’ Diary_
- S. Morgenstern’s _The Princess Bride_

“Comedy” plots should end in a resolution that clears up the confusion that has preceded, and their endings are usually happy as well. However, while these stories are generally lighthearted, remember that challenges and conflict are as important here as with any other narrative.

And while this plot relies on the ridiculous and the surreal, these elements should be balanced with more mundane and everyday circumstances. It’s important to keep this balance in mind when editing these stories.
