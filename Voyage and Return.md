# Voyage and Return

This plot is very similar to “The Quest,” but with one crucial difference: rather than ending when the quest has been completed, it follows the protagonist’s journey home as well.

You can see examples of this plot in:

- Lewis Carroll’s _Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland_
- C. S. Lewis’s _The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe_
- Madeleine L’Engle’s _A Wrinkle in Time_

As with “The Quest,” this plot structure should make use of rising action, building tension as it progresses. Then the falling action, described in [Freytag’s pyramid](https://knowadays.com/blog/narrative-structure-a-guide-to-freytags-pyramid/), should introduce further challenges before the protagonist can head back home.

Putting the most dramatic scenes only in the “Voyage” half can disrupt the flow of this structure, so you may want to highlight this with your client as a potential issue.

It’s also important to remember that the “Return” doesn’t mean a return to the status quo of the beginning of the story. The protagonist should be changed by their journey, whether that change is physical, mental, or emotional, and should bring that new knowledge or ability home with them.
