# Overcoming the Monster

This first basic plot is a staple from fantasy to crime fiction, and it is found in famous works including:

- Bram Stoker’s _Dracula_
- Thomas Harris’s _Red Dragon_
- H.G. Wells’s _War of the Worlds_

In this plot, the “monster” can be a literal creature of evil, a human being, or a more metaphorical force that must be overcome, such as an illness or aggressive ideology.

Whatever form the monster takes, however, it should pose more than just an immediate physical threat to the protagonist. In _Dracula_, for example, the titular vampire is after more than just the protagonist’s blood. The Count plans to expand his territory to England, where he will have access to thousands more victims and threaten the whole modern world.

One way to tell if your client has successfully written an “Overcoming the Monster” plot is by asking the following questions:

- What (or who) is the monster?
- How is the monster defeated?
- What does overcoming the monster achieve?

If the answers to these questions are too one-dimensional, you might suggest that your client revisit the central elements of their plot.
