# Rebirth

“Rebirth” plots focus on the development of a character and their subsequent transformation. 

Stories that follow this structure can be fairy tales that feature a literal transformation, like _Beauty and the Beast_, or works that address a character’s morality, such as:

- Dr. Seuss’s _How the Grinch Stole Christmas_
- Charles Dickens’s _A Christmas Carol_

At the start of the story, the protagonist is affected by a negative force, power, or belief. They then experience several setbacks on their journey towards redemption, such as giving in to temptation or struggling with the choices they need to make. 

Ultimately, the ending is a happy one, but this outcome must depend on the protagonist consciously choosing to change for the better.

Your client’s writing should make clear what the change that triggers the transformation is – if the protagonist achieves their rebirth without having to work for it, you should flag this as an issue.

Of course, you’ll find some stories that contain elements of many of the seven basic plots, and you should never force your client’s work to fit one narrative mold. But knowing what to expect from these common plots can help you better assess the writing you edit.
