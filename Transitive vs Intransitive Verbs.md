Transitive and intransitive verbs are two types of action verbs in English grammar, and they differ in how they interact with objects within a sentence.

1. **Transitive Verbs**: A transitive verb is a verb that requires one or more objects. This type of verb implies that there is an action being done to something or someone. The sentence would be incomplete or make less sense without an object. For example, in the sentence "She reads a book," "reads" is a transitive verb; it is acting on the object "book."
    
2. **Intransitive Verbs**: An intransitive verb, on the other hand, does not require an object to complete its meaning. The action stops with the verb. For example, in the sentence "He sleeps," "sleeps" is an intransitive verb; there is no object receiving the action.
    

It's important to note that some verbs can be both transitive and intransitive, depending on the context. For example, "run" can be used intransitively as in "She runs every morning" (with no object) and transitively as in "She runs a small company" (with the object "a small company").
