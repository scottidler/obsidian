# Offense

We are a spread offense using the `pistol` and `shotgun` formations.
- `Q` (quarterback) depth is at 5yds for `pistol` _and_ `shotgun`
- `T` (tailback another name for running back) is 
	- directly behind the `Q` when in `pistol`
	- to one side of the `Q` at the `B` gap or beyond, slightly behind the `Q`
- `H` or H-Back is a hybrid between the `FB` (fullback) and `TE` (tight-end)
- `Z`  is the #1 `WR` on the Strong side of every formation, _always_ OFF the LOS
- `X` is the #1 `WR` on the Weak side of every formation, _always_ ON the LOS
- `Y` is the #2 `WR` on the Strong side of every formation, _always_ ON the LOS

The movement of primarily one player, `H`, is how we move from one formation to the next. Additionally the `X` maybe move further out when `H` joins the weak side of the formation on `Green` and `Yellow` formations.

We utilize `motion` (moving a player laterally along the line LOS prior to the snap) to get the player into position to make a block or get open for a pass. We want to emphasize moving players from one side of the field, because this stresses and confuses the defense.

## Formations

We utilize 3 primary formations: `Black`, `Green` and `Yellow`. We use the same player name/symbols for all three formations: `Q`, `T`, `H`, `Z`, `X` and `Y`.
#### Black `20 Personnel` 2x1
- `20 Personnel` means `2 RBs` (running backs) in the backfield; `0 TEs` (tight ends); by elimination that leaves 3 `WRs`
- 2x1 means `2 WRs` (wide receivers) on one side and `1 WR` on the other side
#### Green `10 Personnel` 2x2
- `10 Personnel` means `1 RB` in the backfield; `0 TEs`; by elimination that leaves `4 WRs`
- 2x2 means `2 WRs` on one side and `2 WRs` on the other side
#### Yellow `10 Personnel` 3x1
- `10 Personnel` same as above
- 3x1 means `3 WRs` on one side and `1 WR` on the other side

## Plays

words
### Run

words
#### Trap `Bama`
- state: Alabama
- `trap` blocking is a gap scheme where the `DEs` are ignored and instead the `OT` (offensive tackles) go straight for linebackers
- the `C` (center) snaps the ball and then seals the `NT` in the "shade" or a `1-tech` (A gap)
- the `G` (guard) that shares the same A gap with the `C`, pulls around the `C` and hits the `DT`; the rushing player will follow this block
- the other `G` leaves the `DT` (mentioned above) for an inside `LB`
- This play is quick hitting and leaves the `DEs` unblocked because they won't have an opportunity to get in on the play
- meanwhile the play side `G` and the two `Ts` skip to blocking the `LBs` directly
#### Power/Counter `Rado`
- state: Colorado
- gap scheme
- `power` and `counter` blocking is exactly the same except which player "kicks" and which "wraps"
	- `power` has the `H` "kick out" the unblocked `DE`; the pulling `G` wraps through the hole to block the PS (play side) `LB`
	- `counter` is the opposite with the `G` "kicking out" and the `H` "wrapping" through the hole to block the PS `LB`
	- for both, the `DE` is on blocked, because the PS `T` and `G` double team the inside down lineman (`NT` or `DT`) and work back to the _2nd_ `LB`, leaving the 1st for the wrapping player
	- `power` / `counter` are physical runs because every block with leverage with players having clear assignments
	- for simplicity, we have made `power` always go to the strength of the formation and `counter` to weak
#### Inside Zone `Indy`
- state: Indiana
#### Outside Zone `Okie`
- state: Oklahoma
#### Option `Ore`
- state: Oregon
#### Jet `Jersey`
- state: New Jersey

### Pass

#### Snack `Kota`
- state: South Dakota
- three very similar concepts
	- v1 `stick`
	- v2 `snag`
	- v2 `bow`
- 3 player where a player sits near the apex defender, another in the flat and a clear out route. The apex player can't cover both the sit route AND the flat
#### Mesh `Mich`
- state: Michigan
- inside WRs slap hands as the `H` goes _under_ the `Y`
- `H`should pop free on the other side of the OL after clearing the `Y` and `Z` running "rub routes"
#### Cross `Hai`
- state: Hawaii
- two similar concepts
	- v1 `y-cross`
	- v2 `shallow cross`
#### Flood `Flo`
- state: Florida
- flood concept where you "flood" one side of the field with most of the WRs
- setup with we fake zone run and boot
#### Yankee `York`
- state: New York
- this is a shot play where you try to hit a home run
#### Cheese `Wisc`
- state: Wisconsin
- This play features whip-wheel route combos designed to get the wheel route wide open

### Misc

#### Misc `Miss`
- state: Mississippi
