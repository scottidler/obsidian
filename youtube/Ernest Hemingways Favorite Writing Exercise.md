An aspiring writer once asked Ernest Hemingway, ‚ÄúHow can a writer train himself?‚Äù Hemingway shared an exercise for sharpening a writer's observational skills so they can vividly describe their experiences on paper. This exercise can be broken down into three-steps and gives us a fantastic way to practice ‚Äúshow, don‚Äôt tell‚Äù in our writing. Here's the full text of Hemingway's article "Monologue to the Maestro": https://dianedrake.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Hemingway-Monologue-to-the-Maestro1.pdf
