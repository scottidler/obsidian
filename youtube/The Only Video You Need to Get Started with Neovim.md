## Description
Going from no set up to being instantly productive using kickstart.nvim in #nvim.

Check out the repo, it has detailed instructions for installing on your OS: https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim

If you really like my teaching style, I'm working on courses for https://boot.dev/teej - Feel free to ask me more in stream :)

Links for Copy Pasting:
- You have to of course install neovim! https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md
- PLEASE READ ** https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/  ** PLEASE READ
- IF YOU HAVE AN EXISTING CONFIG, PLEASE READ WHAT TO DO FROM KICKSTART README: https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/?tab=readme-ov-file#faq

The command I pasted (on linux):
- git clone https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim

NOTE: You can't have anything in your nvim folder for this to work. So back up your old config (if you have any) and then remove the folder.
