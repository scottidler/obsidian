Alien, the 1979 landmark science fiction film from director Ridley Scott, really can't be talked about or praised enough. The movie represented a major shift in tone for the genre at the time, and led to one of the greatest film sequels in history with Aliens a few years later. But Alien is so much more than that. It's a milestone in cinematography and directing in general, with some of the greatest camera moves and compositions I've ever seen. Today, I'll look at some of those visual choices made by Ridley Scott and his cinematographer, and even draw some unlikely comparisons with one of my favorite shows of all time.
