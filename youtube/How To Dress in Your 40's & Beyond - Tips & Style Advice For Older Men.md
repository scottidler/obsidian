## Description
Welcome back to my channel! This video is for all of you older gents out there! FYI 40 is NOT old üòâIn this video I talk about how to dress in your 40's and beyond and I outline some crucial tips as well as some casual staple pieces you should have in your closet. I didn't want to make the video too long so I will probably do a separate video for more formal wear if that's something you would all be interested in. If you have any questions/comments be sure to leave them down below! I hope you enjoy and find this helpful ‚ù§Ô∏è
