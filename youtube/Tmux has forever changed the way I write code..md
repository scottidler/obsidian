## Description
Before tmux, I spent most of my time working in graphical editors and interfaces, and found working in the terminal difficult to do.

After moving to tmux and learning how to configure it to suit my needs, I now spend nearly all my time whilst writing code in tmux.

In this video, I share the configuration that Iâ€™ve developed over the years to improve my own productivity, and why you may want to consider using tmux yourself.
