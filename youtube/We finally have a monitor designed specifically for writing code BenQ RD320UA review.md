## Description
This monitor calls itself "the best monitor for programming", and it might just be very well be the case.

The BenQ RD320UA is the newest product in their series of montiors for programmers, and it's the first monitor I've owned that I've not only been truly impressed by, but has made me excited to work on my desk.

Disclosures:

- BenQ sent this monitor to me for free in order to do a review.
- No money changed hands, but I do get to keep the monitor
- Every other product mentioned in this video I bought myself.

Amendments:
BenQ notified me that my understanding of Night Mode plus was off. BI.Gen2 uses ambient light to adjust the screen brightness whereas Night Hours Plus allows you to lower the display brightness to less than 1 nit, which can be activated manually or when the sensor detects low-light conditions.
