## Description
Finding a job is tough... even tougher when you're an older adult and you're experiencing subtle or hidden ageism. (and these days even 45+ is considered an older job seeker)

In this video, I share with you examples of subtle ageism, why it happens, and what the coded language means... AND WHAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT and turn the tables to make your case.

IMPORTANT | The 🔥 starts at 4:00 - 12:00 min and some people are going to have their minds blown 🤯 about what REALLY happens and why.  

IMPORTANT !!!! Around min. 10:00 I suggest what older job seekers can say or do to make their care... AND tell employers why they should get off autopilot, break the mold, and get REAL about how people and the world work today... and of course why older job seekers can be such a great find. 

In addition to creating Advanced Adulting. I also am a former executive recruiter/headhunter where I spent over 15 years placing executives. I share with you the good the bad the ugly truth of what REALLY goes on... and how you can take control. 

Here is the real deal. 👇

Think of it like a job search version of Anthony Bourdain'es "Kitchen Confidential"... where he blew the lid off what really happens in restaurants. This is what really happens and why... and how you can call BS when you experience it. 

Some employers and virtue-signaling HR people and career coaches may not like what I have to say.... but that doesn't make it wrong. 🤷‍♂️💯🎯

This is a conversation | and presentation I had with a group of my Advanced Adulting Community at one of our weekly calls. It's pretty raw and real. 

This advice isn't textbook.. it IS REAL and works. Forget playing by the old rules... you have to take care of yourself... and I'll show you how. 

Let me hear from you. Leave a comment or share it with your friends.
