## Description
The best writing advice I got is from Mr. Smith, a high school teacher, who taught that writing should communicate ideas to others, not just express personal flair.

Robert Greene is the author of the New York Times bestsellers The 48 Laws of Power, The Art of Seduction, The 33 Strategies of War, The 50th Law, Mastery, The Laws of Human Nature, and most recently, The Daily Laws.
