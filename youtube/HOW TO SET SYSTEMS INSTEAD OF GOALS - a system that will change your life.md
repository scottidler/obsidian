## Description
"You don't rise to the level of your goals; you fall to the level of your systems." -James Clear
 HOW TO SET SYSTEMS INSTEAD OF GOALS | a system that will change your life
In this video I share why goals are incomplete and how to set systems instead. If you can get your habits, systems, and then goals in place, you can reach your dreams. If you want to reach your goals, you need to get your systems in order. This has been life-changing for me and I hope this system will change your days, weeks, months, and life as well.

‚ú® I turned this video into a planner!!! You can check out the 2024 Goal Planner + Visualization workbook out at: https://alexiskingsley.com ‚ú® 

üìñ Chunk your year's intentions into quarterly sprints, monthly projects, weekly systems, and daily actions to go from just having good intentions to living an intentional life with the Intentional Planner.
