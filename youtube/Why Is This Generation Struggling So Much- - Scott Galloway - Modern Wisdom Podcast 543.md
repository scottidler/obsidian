## Description
Scott Galloway is a clinical professor of marketing at the New York University Stern School of Business, a public speaker, entrepreneur and an author.

Expect to learn why covid worsened the wealth gap more than it already was, why TikTok is a trojan stallion which should be banned, why news pundits suck so much, what makes a news story go viral, Scott's advice to young people on how to maximise effectiveness in life, the most important things to focus on in order to be happy and much more...
