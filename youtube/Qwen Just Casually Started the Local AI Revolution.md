## Description
Qwen-2.5-Coder-32b was JUST released, an open source LLM that is fine-tuned for coding but also performs VERY well in agentic workflows. This model CRUSHES all benchmarks, especially for coding, and even outperforms Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o in many ways as you can see on the Ollama library page for the model!

Let me just say - what a time to be alive! Especially for local and open source AI! I say the local AI revolution has started because Qwen-2.5-Coder-32b has really proved that we're nearing the point of local AI being as good as the big guys like GPT and Claude. It's only a matter of time.

In this video, I dive into my own testing for Qwen-2.5-Coder-32b, including trying it out with oTToDev (our Bolt.new fork) and an AI agent I created specifically to test new LLMs like this. I appreciate benchmarks, don't get me wrong, but I always want to try more practical things like this, and I wanted to share it with you too! And man, this model surpasses all my expectations and the performance of ANY other local LLM, even the larger ones!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Give Novita a shot today - it's honestly my new favorite platform for GPU instances and LLM inference. Not just because of our collab for this video but because of all the features I talk about in the video that I genuinely appreciate - the insanely competitive pricing, flexibility of your GPU instances, ease of setup, and the uniqueness of their available models.

Using the link below will help support me as a creator as well! :)

Artificial Intelligence is no doubt the future of not just software development but the whole world. And I'm on a mission to master it - focusing first on mastering AI Agents.

Join me as I push the limits of what is possible with AI. I'll be uploading videos at least two times a week - Sundays and Wednesdays at 7:00 PM CDT! Sundays and Wednesdays are for everything AI, focusing on providing insane and practical educational value. I will also post sometimes on Fridays at 7:00 PM CDT - specifically for platform showcases - sometimes sponsored, always creative in approach!
