Stuff we use:
CAMERA - This is the camera we have used to film 90+% of our interviews (over 200 interviews and counting)  It continues to be our workhorse - http://amzn.to/2u66V1J

LENS - Most people ask us what camera we use, no one ever asks about the lens which filmmakers always tell us is more important.  This lens was a big investment for us and one we wish we could have made sooner.  Started using this lens at the end of 2013 - http://amzn.to/2tbtmOq

AUDIO 

Rode VideoMic Pro  - The Rode mic helps us capture our backup audio.  It also helps us sync up our audio in post http://amzn.to/2t1n2hx

Audio Recorder - If we had to do it all over again, this is probably the first item we would have bought - http://amzn.to/2tbFlM9

LIGHTS - Although we like to use as much natural light as we can, we often enhance the lighting with this small portable light.  We have two of them and they have saved us a number of times - http://amzn.to/2u5UnHv
