## Description
Dr. [[Andrew Huberman]] describes the billionaire habits and success habits of the ultra rich, opening doors on how to unlock your brain to its highest potential. You are your thoughts, and you can alter how you think with the correct conscious behaviors. Listen to this every morning after you wake up, or every night before you go to bed, and achieve greatness!

## Notes
- procedural memory: visualize step by step your desired new habit; helps habits form faster more robust
- [[task bracketing]] pairing a good habit with a bad habit
	- action execution "go"
	- action suppression "no go"
