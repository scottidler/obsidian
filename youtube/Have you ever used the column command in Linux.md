## Description
Yes, there's other tools that can make terminal output prettier on Linux. We all know that. But the "column" command is likely already there, on your system, waiting for you to use it.

With "column" you can get nice looking terminal output & JSON from terminal commands, without a lot of additional cruft!

I mentioned a few print materials in this episode, here's some links:
📖 The AWK book: https://archive.org/details/pdfy-MgN0H1joIoDVoIC7
📘 The K/P UNIX book: https://archive.org/details/unixprogramminge0000kern
🔐 1979's "Password Security: A Case History" by Robert Morris and Ken Thompson, which talks about how password encryption evolved in early UNIX: https://rist.tech.cornell.edu/6431papers/MorrisThompson1979.pdf
