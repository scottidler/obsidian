## Description
Talking points: sex, social media, conditioning, culture

I know what it’s like to feel controlled by your own sexed-up brain. Like you’re losing hours of your day, mental bandwidth and more to clothes-less strangers on the internet.

So I wanted to lay down some real talk about what I've done—and how hard it can be—to de-sexualize my brain and stay disciplined. I also get into some of the benefits it’s hard for me, my business, and my relationship. Listen in.


(00:00:00) - Intro and why I’m talking about this
(00:03:37) - Not only is your brain probably overstimulated, it’s probably avoiding something
(00:05:02) - You’re going to have to get some excitement somewhere
(00:06:58) - Cut out thirsty triggers
(00:10:11) - Stop chasing empty dopamine “calories”
(00:11:11) - Use tech properly
(00:13:25) - Use BETTER tools
