## Description
The Okta-awscli project is designed to provide Okta authentication for the AWS Command Line Interface (awscli). This solution enables users to securely authenticate with Okta to access AWS services and resources via the command line. By integrating Okta's authentication capabilities with the awscli, users can leverage Okta's robust security features including multi-factor authentication, single sign-on, and adaptive access policies. The project is hosted on GitHub under the okta-awscli repository. Developers can contribute to the project by creating an account on GitHub and collaborating with the project maintainers and contributors.
