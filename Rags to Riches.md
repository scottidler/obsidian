# Rags to Riches

The fairy tale _Cinderella_ might be the first thing this plot brings to mind, but it is used in a wider variety of stories than you might expect. Other famous examples include:

- Charles Dickens’s _Oliver Twist_ 
- Louis Sachar’s _Holes_
- Charlotte Bronte’s _Jane Eyre_

As with the previous plot’s “monster,” the “riches” here don’t necessarily have to be literal money. Instead, this term can refer to anything the protagonist originally lacks, such as wealth, freedom, or something else entirely.

The key with this plot is that it’s not a simple case of a protagonist magically gaining whatever they need for a happy ending. There must be challenges involved, and the protagonist must adjust so they can successfully live with their newfound riches. 

Often, the initial “riches” are obtained in a way beyond the protagonist’s control (such as with the help of a [fairy godmother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_godmother)), while the final return to wealth and happiness is achieved through their own agency.

As such, you should make sure your client has introduced enough conflict and character growth into a “Rags to Riches” story to make it a satisfying read.
