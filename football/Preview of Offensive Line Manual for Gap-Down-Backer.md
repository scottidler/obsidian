## Description
"Gap-Down-Backer“ is used by offensive lines from the pros all the way down to youth teams. It is primarily used on Power, Counter, and Buck. The scheme also involves a kick-out block on the play side and a wrap from a backside player that picks up a linebacker on the play side. It is very simple for young offensive linemen to learn. Because it is simple, it enables the OL to be certain and sure of themselves. Football players that are “certain and sure” are more aggressive than players that are tentative and unsure.
The manual includes easy-to-read diagrams, pictures of techniques being executed, coaching points, drills, complete blocking rules for several plays, video clips of teams using the G-D-B scheme, links to GREAT teaching videos on YouTube, exclusive access to G-D-B clinic video, access to Coach Chip if you have any questions.
