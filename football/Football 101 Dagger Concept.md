# Football 101 Dagger Concept

<iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VfrvkorPwSI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Description
The Dagger Concept is a longer developing play that attacks the middle of the field. Small adjustments can be made within the concept to attack multiple coverages and itâ€™s a great play against both one and two safety looks.
