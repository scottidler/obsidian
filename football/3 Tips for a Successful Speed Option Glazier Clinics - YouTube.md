## Description
Speaker Name: Tony Aneese
﻿Speaker Position: Head Coach
﻿Speaker School: Ferris State University 

In this video, Head Coach Tony Annese from Ferris State University describes a speed option concept that you can implement into any offense. Mostly ran out of Multi-Option spread systems, this simple adjustment focuses on getting the ball on the perimeter as fast as possible into the hands of your running backs for a huge gain.
 
The three biggest tips for this to be effective are (1). The Quarterbacks' only priority is to attack the pitch key, end man on the defensive line. If he can’t get to the running back, pitch the ball. (2) Get the running back into open space on the field so he can get a one-on-one matchup with a defender and make him miss. (3) The play-side offensive guard/tackle must arch block and reach the second level of the defense to wall off the pursuing defenders to create an alley for the running back to gain yards. 

All three of these tips are simple to coach techniques that could provide immediate success for your offense. The name of the game is “Speed and Space” for the speed option!
