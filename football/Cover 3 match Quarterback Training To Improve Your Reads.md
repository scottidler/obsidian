What is Cover 3 Match?  Defenses Use it  to Help with the Run and Play the Verticals.  QB's Need to Know It! (Fans will Love this too!)



Got a great viewer question today on something I've been meaning to do for a long time. Now, today we're talking about three match, we're going to look at the concept, we're going to look at how it plays versus two by two and three by one, where to check out college game film, we're going to talk about the nuance, and we're just gonna dive inGot a great viewer question today on something I've been meaning to do for a long time. Now, today we're talking about three match, we're going to look at the concept, we're going to look at how it plays versus two by two and three by one, where to check out college game film, we're going to talk about the nuance, and we're just gonna dive in.

Very simply, three matches a concept as legend has it that Nick Saban came up with when he was working in the NFL, because they lost three games to Pittsburgh. And so he's trying to figure out a way that he could  spin to a single high safety and have better run support to stop the running game for Pittsburgh and not get torched by verticals up the field. And so originally, three match was pattern match in terms of defense, so three pattern match. And what they're trying to do is essentially take out those vertical routes by the twos in two by two, and by the by number two and three and a three by one. So that way, you can stop the vertical game, but still support the run with those players down low in the box. Since that time, a lot of college teams have spun different variations of three match off and they've changed the coverage. When run properly on vertical routes. It looks like cover one. And when you're watching film, sometimes you say that's cover one, it's cover three can't tell a difference. Well, that's probably three match. And so let's dive into the film. I'll take a look at a diagram. First I'll show you what three match is all about. And then we'll hit the college game film. And we'll talk about the nuance of it. And I'll show you a little difference in the diagram what some college teams have done to change it up and actually bring some pressure with it.

Two by two, three match great diagram here from Pat's pulpit, and I'll put a link down below. So you can check it out, they got a great article on three match. But these guys are deep thirds player by nature of the call. So standard cover three rules in terms of that. Now, if their player goes vertical, they become man players. And that's normal for cover three, when a guy comes into your zone, you would be on top of them. Any zone converts demand eventually with the guy in your zone. So they get vertical converts to zone. The difference in three match is that the hook flat players strong safety in this case and nickel in this case, rather than just buzzing to a zone right now, if their player releases vertically, they're going to lock onto that match that pattern and run with the vertical route a lock in run vertical, they do it on an outside hip, so they're looking into the ball, it does two things for you A, it forces that route closer to the safety so that the safety has a shorter length of field to cover in the middle of field. That's number one. Number two, it makes it so they can play the ball looking outside. And so they're looking at the quarterback playing like a receiver. So it's a great scheme to stop 4 verticals. As I said, the concept was so that you get the extra box player down low now you have a seven man box and you can defend the run better, but teams were killing single high safety with 4 verticals in this case. When you run with the verticals a quarterback has to make a perfect throw. Now, if these players don't go vertical inside of five yards with the original rule, then the safety will then just buzz the flat if this player runs a shallow this nickle defender will then be your flat buzz defender and you're good to go. Just play straight cover 3.
