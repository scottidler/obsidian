## Description
A "Freeze" play is where the offense lines up at the line of scrimmage in a designed formation. The Quarterback uses a "dummy" snap count where no matter what he says, there is no play and the ball will not be snapped. The point is to first get the defense to cross the neutral zone and be offsides. This will result in a "free" play where the offense takes a vertical shot downfield. If the defense does not cross the neutral zone, the offense turns to the sideline and gets the play call from the coaching staff. This allows the offensive play caller to view the defense and pick the best play call to attack their alignment.
