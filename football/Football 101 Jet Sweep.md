## Description
The Jet Sweep is a perimeter-attacking play that forces the defense to flow hard to pre-snap motion. It’s most often used at the high school level where the hashes allow offenses to exploit wide sides of the field with their athletes getting a running head start. However, it is also used extensively at the college and NFL levels with many teams using the Jet Sweep as window dressing to other run plays and as a change-of-pace play to hold defenses accountable when they don’t respect the motion.
