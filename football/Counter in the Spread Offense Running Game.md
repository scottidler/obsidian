# Counter in the Spread Offense Running Game - YouTube

## Description
This video is a chalk talk about counter in the spread offense running game. It allows you to get movement at the point of attack and get your linemen out in space in front of your RB. Its's also a really adaptable play. You can tag it with motion, or jet action.  It's my absolute favorite play against a stunting defense.
