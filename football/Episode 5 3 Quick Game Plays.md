## Description
Now that we have set the table with #4Verts and the #7yardRule, we can get deep into our Quick Game Plays... We will run the Stick, Corner and Fade out concepts throughout the season. Let's chat about how we use these 3 plays to attack the same 3 pieces of grass in 3 different ways, keeping the defense off balanced and on their heels. #MiddleSchoolAirRaid #YouthAirRaid #YouthFootball
