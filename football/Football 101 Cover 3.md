## Description
Cover 3 is a zone defense with corners and safeties protecting the deep thirds of the field. Each sideline is covered by the corners and the middle of the field by the safety. That leaves four defenders to cover the underneath zones. Cover 3 allows the defense to keep defenders in the box for the run game while continuing to cover deep and prevent the big play.
