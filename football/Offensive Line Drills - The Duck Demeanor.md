## Description
Here's how to teach your O-Linemen to play on their insoles by practicing the Duck Demeanor. I learned this from legendary O-Line Coach Jim McNally when I played for the NY Giants.

The Bober Academy was founded in 2019 by 8 year NFL Veteran Chris Bober with the Mission to train and develop athletes to maximize their potential and succeed on the gridiron by coaching the fundamentals of offensive line technique. The Bober Academy believes in laying the the building blocks of O-Line Success first then repeating over and over until mastered. The Bober Academy offers O-Line instruction for all ages and skill levels through camps, clinics, & one to one learning. 

Chris Bober went from a walk-on at Division II UNO to NFL starter by hard work, determination, & becoming a master of Offensive Line technique. After graduating from Omaha South High School Chris redshirted then became a 4 year starter helping his team win NCC Conference Champions in 1996 & 1998. He was a team captain and named to All America Team after his Junior & Senior seasons. Chris went undrafted in the 2000 NFL Draft & signed with the NY Giants. He was cut after his rookie training camp, signed to the Practice Squad & finally to the active roster for the 2000 NFC Champion Giants. Chris stayed with Giants 4 seasons becoming the starting Center in 2002-2003. In 2004 Chris signed a free agent contract with the Kansas City Chiefs where he played 4 seasons starting games at Guard & Tackle. Chris retired in 2008 after multiple hip surgeries.
