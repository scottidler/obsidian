# Zone Blocking Families

<iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EfpHSSx3HIE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Description
We divide Zone Blocking into 3 Families. 

1) Inside / Tight Zone - Playside A gap to backside, can bounce; downhill run

2) Mid Zone - Playside B gap, look like wide zone and hit tighter

3) Wide Zone / Stretch - Playside C gap to backside, can bounce; not an outside run, a wide run that hits inside the tackles who have just moved wider
