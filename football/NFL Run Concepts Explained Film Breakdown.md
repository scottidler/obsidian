## Description
In this film breakdown, we're going back to the basics, looking at the most popular run concepts in the NFL, including how they're schemed up, how they work, and who runs them the best. Also, I dive into the blocking required for these plays, and how those work, like reach blocks, overtakes, double teams, pulling lead blocks, etc. The basic concepts that an NFL run game is built are, are pretty simple. However, there are dozens of wrinkles within those plays that are all designed to create the perfect play against whatever defensive front they get. Here, I try to get into all of that, and show you what makes an NFL run game go.
