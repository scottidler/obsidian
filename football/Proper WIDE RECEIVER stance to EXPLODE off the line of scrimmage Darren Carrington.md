## Description
Former Oregon Duck and Utah Utes WR, and current NFL Free Agent Darren Carrington displays how to get into a proper wide receiver stance in order to get the MOST explosion off the line of scrimmage. Explaining how to distribute your weight, creating tension in your back calf, keeping your hips square, pushing off your front leg, and having your hands ready to combat any press coverage in order to fire out of your stance at the snap of the ball.
