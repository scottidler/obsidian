## Description
Get exclusive access to my 4-2-5 Defense Video series right now, at http://425defense.com/youtube. Learn the foundations of The 425 Defense System, how to implement it with your football team at any level, and how to game plan for Spread Offenses or Wing-T Attacks.

The Strong End in your 4-4 Defense or 4-2-5 Defense is responsible for the C Gap. Most coaches play him inside shade of the Tight End to control the gap without being down blocked. But if you use this technique to coach your Strong Defensive End to play the head-up 6-Technique, he can handle the C Gap and still help your defense to extend the edge on outside run plays.
