Hey everybody, I'm Mike Pawlawski, former 11 year pro quarterback and quarterbacks coach here at https://www.eliteathletestv.com. Today we're talking about the snag route. If it's not in your offense, it should be in your offense, because it's a great concept. I see it week in and week out on college film and High School film. Teams run it all the time. But today we're going to talk about a different way to run it because you want to break tendencies. As a quarterback, you need to understand how to read the Snag concept. But if you run the same stretches, it makes it easy on the eyes for young quarterbacks. And so we're going to talk about a way to run snag from two by two that you can be extremely efficient.  You can stretch defenses and you can find mismatches. It's a nice addition to any offense.

This video is a simple way to keep the same exact stretch keep a quarterback comfortable in terms of where his eyes have to be while you give a defense a different look and break tendencies. The snag concept is a great concept to get that stretch in the flat, find the pick versus man and still have a viable option versus zone. Run it in bunch, from trips and from  2X2 and use your back as that third receiver. If your back can catch this is a good weapon in your arsenal.
