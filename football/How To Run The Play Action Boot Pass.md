## Description
The Play Action Boot Pass is a simple concept that helps you layer your offense, assuming you can run the ball well. If you have a DE that crashes in or LBs who over pursue,  throwing in a boot pass can get you easy yards. This should be a staple in every offense. 

Most of the time this is run with a flood concept but this doesn't always need to be the case.
