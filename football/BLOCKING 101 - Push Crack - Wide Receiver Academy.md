## Description
The best Wide Receivers in the world block their asses off, so should you!
Requirements for blocking:
✅ Unselfish Mindset
✅ Attitude
✅ Effort
-
Keys to a good block:
🔑 DON’T TAKE A PENALTY THAT SETS THE DRIVE BACK
🔑 Know the play that is being run. Be active in learning more than just your routes in the pass game.
🔑 Understand leverage & positioning.
🔑 Block the most dangerous threat who can make the tackle.
-
“PUSH CRACK”
1️⃣ Pre-snap: identify where the safety is located
2️⃣ Snap of the ball: sprint off the LOS at the corner
3️⃣ Be patient and wait for corner or safety to attack the ball. If the safety attacks hard into the box, simply redirect your route to block the safety, leaving the corner to try to make the tackle.
-
🧠 Keep in mind that safeties and linebackers are better at stopping the run than corners!
