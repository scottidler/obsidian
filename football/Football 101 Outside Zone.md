# Football 101 Outside Zone - YouTube

## Description
Outside zone has been a part of NFL run games for decades. It started to become popular in the 1980s and in the 1990s with Alex Gibbs and Mike Shanahan. It has become even more popular in the past few years with Kyle Shanahan and Sean McVay basing their entire offenses around the scheme. The scheme attacks space instead of players and offers a versatile play that doesnâ€™t demand vertical movement and instead stresses defenses on the perimeter.
