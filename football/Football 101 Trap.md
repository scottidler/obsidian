# Football 101 Trap

<iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yAUqGQmYhX8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Description
Trap is an aggressive and quick hitting play with pulling linemen. Different from power and counter, it targets interior defenders instead with trap blocks. Trap hits fast and needs to be timed well with narrow running lanes for the running back down the middle of the defense.
With a shorter distance to pull, trap is a fast play that intentionally leaves an interior defensive lineman unblocked. That defensive tackle then gets “trapped” by the pulling backside guard. Leaving the defensive tackle unblocked allows for an interior offensive lineman to immediately climb to the second level. It also exposes interior defenders to different looks and blocks. It slows down their disruptiveness and gets the offense a numbers advantage in the middle of the defense.
