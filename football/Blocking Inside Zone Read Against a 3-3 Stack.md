## Description
If you happen to struggle with blocking inside zone read against a 3-3 stack, then this video will help.  You'll be able to simplify the communication with your Offensive Linemen which will help them play faster and with more certainty. 

I dissect blocking inside zone read against a 3-3 stack.  You'll see how i account for the 6 man box using the number system.  I also break down the QB's read on the backside and how to correctly identify the right defender.
