## Description
"Brennan Marion is the creator of the 'Go-Go Offense,' which he has run to success at every one of his coaching stops. In short, the Go-Go Offense is an uptempo one, specifically designed to run the ball downhill. It's about tempo and spacing, using multiple formations to get favorable match-ups to run the ball. Its main formation is aligning the QB in the shotgun with two backs on the same side of the QB. Contrary to popular belief, it's a big play offense predicated on chunk plays, which come from teams over-committing to stop the run." - Emory Hunt in The Athletic
