## Description
Check out the brand new Speaking Football course where you can learn everything you need to be fluent in football and get the building blocks to understand more advanced schemes, thoughts, and gameplay.

The Hank concept (Curl/Flat) is a West Coast staple and is used at all levels of football. It is best against Cover 3 and wants to exploit both the hook and flat defenders.
