# How To Run The Yankee Concept Deep Shot - YouTube

<iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nJccIGt-4Cs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Description
The Yankee Concept is the go-to deep shot play for Offensive Coordinators. It's best run vs a 1 high safety look but there are variations that allow you to run this from a 2 high safety look as well. You'll see this base concept and variations of this multiple times EVERY NFL game (not an exaggeration, it's that common) by both teams. 

It's a difficult throw to make for young QBs so generally this is only used at the higher levels with QBs who can potentially air it out 60 yards, but most of the time this is completed to in the 18-22 yard range or shorter.
