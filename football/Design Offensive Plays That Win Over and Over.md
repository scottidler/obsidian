Like Jiu Jitsu If You Design Plays To Take Advantage Of Your Opponents  Strengths and Your Tendencies You Can Create Leverage


So many times when coaches are designing offenses, they have set plays set formations, and that's what they run. But what happens when a defense figures you out? Well, the air raid and the run and shoot are both really good at the concept I'm going to show you today. But when the defense figures you out, you have to have an answer. And I'm going to show you how to build one.
So let's talk about how we take a single play and make it into several plays or change the concept and stay within the framework of our offense. Everybody's heard of the hitch and go and the out and up? Those are simple, right? You're running hitches and then the corner starts to bite and you run the hitching go, you run the out and the corner starts to squat and you run the outrun up simple. And that's what we're talking about today. When you design plays that have built in leverages to them built in reads to them, and defenses start to squat or start to sit on those reads. Then what's your answer? 
I want you to start thinking creatively about your offense. There's answers out there. For instance 4 verts if teams start going cover 4 to 4 verts run comebacks on the outside or take a middle bender by the #2 receiver. Simple answer to a complex problem that you can stay within your system and add to it. As a coach, you can either call it or you can have it built into your system where receivers fall off versus cover for in 4 vert.  Versus snag, if you have linebackers that jump that route, you can get to four vert, but you do want to have that four vert on the back side. That way you have that stretch against a single high safety. Again, just be creative with what you're doing on offense. I love it as a quarterback, when you can evolve through plays with concepts that you already own, and make it seem way more complex. So your complexity is built into the simplicity of what you're calling. I heard that from Troy Taylor at Sac State, and I thought it was beautiful. And that's what you want to do as a coach.
