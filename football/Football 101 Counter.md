# Football 101 Counter

## Description
Counter is a staple of gap scheme run games. It gets linemen on the move and creates man advantage opportunities in the box. Counter can be run a lot of different ways with different players pulling and going across the formation. Who pulls sometimes changes the verbiage of what the play is called, but the core counter concept remains the same.
