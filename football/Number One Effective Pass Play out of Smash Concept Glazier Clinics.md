## Description
Speaker Name: Jarrett Troxler
﻿Speaker Position: Co-Offensive Coordinator/Quarterbacks
﻿Speaker School: Massillon Washington HS (OH)

Coach Jarrett Troxler from Massillon Washington HS (OH) provides his number one passing play to run with a smash concept, “Smash Trail Post Tag”. This passing play is run out of any 2x2 passing formation and guarantees instant downfield success!

The Smash Trail Post Tag is set up with a standard smash concept on the left side of the field. The inside Wide Receiver executes a corner route at 5-8 yards, while the outside Wide Receiver executes an out-route or a hitch to isolate the cornerback.

The genius of this play is what happens on the opposite side of the field. On the other side, the outside Wide Receiver at the snap will take a hard angle to get in a “trail” position behind the Inside Wide Receiver. The Outside Wide Receiver will trail until the Inside Wide Receiver makes his cut to continue his corner route. At this point, the Outside Wide Receiver breaks and executes a skinny post route to the middle of the field. This small wrinkle combined with the smash concept on the other side of the field puts the defense in a bad position.

The Quarterback’s primary read on this play is the trail post route. If one of the Safeties rotates, then the Trail Wide Receiver knows to transform his route, from a post to a dig to stay in from of the middle third deep safety. If all deep options are covered, the Quarterback has his check-down route in the hitch available for a short gain.

A very complex play that will leave the defense guessing every time!
