Joel Penner, the Head Coach at Dordt University, has mastered the modern Gun Triple Option Offense!
 
Coach Penner has stayed true to Gun Triple’s traditional commitment to running the football, leading his offense to the #3 ranked rushing attack in the NAIA in 2023, but he also embraces the fact that in today’s game, you must throw to win.
 
The principles have allowed Dordt to average almost 250 yards per game, and 5.6 yards per carry in 2023, while averaging nearly 400 yards of total offense per game!

In this video, coach Penner talks about two of the Speed Option variations that they use at Dordt University!
