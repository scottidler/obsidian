## Description
We have some Dawgs in the house today Tyler Booker, the Freshman All American from Alabama. Owen Aliciene, four star ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ high school offensive lineman. Thades another great high school offensive lineman. 

The energy in the building was great! And that inspired me to come up with this game like situation drill. 

In this drill, I want the guys to focus on Pad level! They need to focus on moving quick while moving efficiently.

I got great feedback from this drill. The athletes loved it, and this became a EDD (Every Day Drill).
