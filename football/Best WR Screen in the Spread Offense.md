# Best WR Screen in the Spread Offense - YouTube

## Description
In my opinion, this is the best WR screen in the spread offense. It gets the defense moving East and West and takes advantage of reaction to the stretch play. It is a simple throw for the QB with big play opportunity.  Go to http://winwiththepass.com/free-air-raid-playbook/ to get a free download of the Air Raid Playbook.
