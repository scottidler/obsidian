## Description
Understanding Cover 3 Cloud makes it easier for Quarterbacks to make good decisions.


Hey everybody, welcome to elite athletes TV. I'm Mike Pawlawski, former 11 year pro quarterback and quarterbacks coach here at https://www.eliteathletestv.com. Today we're talking about cover 3 cloud, we've gone over three sky, we've gotten over three and nickel looks and three match. I want to talk about three cloud today.
3 cloud is what it sounds like the C in cloud. Because people in football love alliteration stands for corner. So corner, 3 corner, the corner rolls to the flat. Usually when you rotate coverage, you're talking about where you're rotating to if you run three sky, the safety rotates down and becomes that flat defender. If you run three cloud, the corner rotates down and becomes that flat defender. We're gonna take a look at my Tampa Bay Buccaneers playbook. And I'll show you a diagram with three cloud right now. And we'll talk about why teams are doing it nowadays.
When most people think of cover three, they think of three sky very simply, as I just explained the safety, strong safety in this case is in the flat. And we're rotating to 3 deep cover 3, in case you don't know is three deep in coverage. The three stands for three guys, each one of them has a third deep underneath, you have everybody else in their standard zones. We're taking the hook to curl hook to curl and flat by the will linebacker cover three is a nice run support defense, you get the strong safety down, he can be on the edge of the box to help out you can keep the will in the box. So you can get a seven man box if you would like it and the SAM comes as the fourth rusher in this odd front. Now, you can change this around a little bit but you get more people inside the box to help support run. When we go to cover 3 cloud the corner is now the roll flat defender in the safety is taking that high third, that's the only major change as you can see, although you do have the SAM backer now dropping out to take that hook to curl as well in this diagram doesn't have to happen that way. But generally speaking, you're gonna need somebody in that hook zone. And they're bringing the Mike instead. So just one of the change ups that you that you see, obviously, this was an NFL playbook at the time that was in vogue.

The strengths to me of three cloud are that you can jam a good receiver on the outside, you can reroute him, force him to change up his timing on his route and create problems for the quarterback. By rerouting him, you can also be pretty strong against bubble screens, you got somebody coming out your way. And quick flat routes because you have a corner who's already in the flat doesn't have to roll to it doesn't have to make a decision in terms of leverage.

Secondly, just like cover 3 sky, you have three deep zones, you can see strong safety rolls over the top free safety takes the middle right corner drops into the deep third, a lot of teams and that's why it's in vogue these days, are using this to disguise three match or to disguise from cover two to three cloud to give quarterbacks a different look. And so by doing this, they're making quarterbacks hold the ball for a bit longer, maybe confusing them a little bit in terms of coverage, and potentially getting them to throw into coverage that they would normally throw into. 
What are the problems with 3 cloud? Well, as we talked about it's strong to the flat that you're rolling to. But it is weak two, the flat has the same weakness that cover three has in the flat as a quarterback when you see single high safety. You're thinking I've got flats that I can attack with high lows with in and outs with two on ones outside and so you get the same weakness in the flat weather that you are not rolling to that you are rotating a wave from. So that's one weakness. Second weakness because the strong safety isn't coming down and being an edge of box or overhang player. You're not as strong in run support. Having a corner on the outside as your flat defender means that your run support isn't nearly as strong as it is with your strong safety coming down. So you take away a box player, and you're not as strong in run support.
That's a little quarterback training for you. Hopefully we improved your football skills your knowledge of a game made you a better player.
