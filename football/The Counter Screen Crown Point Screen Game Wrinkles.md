In this series, Craig Buzea, the Head Coach at Crown Point High School (Indiana) talks through his offensive system which predicates itself on multiple simplicities which means running a small number of plays in a large number of ways. This video specifically focuses on Crown Point's Counter Screen Wrinkle which has been super effective for them!
