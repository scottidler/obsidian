# Football 101 Yankee Concept - YouTube

<iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LHvlXuppTIA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Description
The Yankee concept is a two-man route concept that is primarily used out of run-heavy formations to attack single-high safety looks like Cover 1 or Cover 3. Itâ€™s a deep shot play that puts the middle field defender in conflict with a deep over route and a post behind it.
