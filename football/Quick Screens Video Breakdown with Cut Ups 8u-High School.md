## Description
Whether you run AirRaid, Wing T, Triple Option or Run and Shoot, Quick Screens need to be a huge part of your game plan. A wise man once told me, "if you finish a game and you feel like you didn't run enough Quick Screens, then you probably are right." These plays should be considered another version of sweep in your #playbook and be utilized as such throughout the game. The Quick Screen may be the best representation of the core mission of the Air Raid... getting your best athletes the ball in space.

We have two (2) types of Quick Screens we love. The traditional Bubble Screen (Larry/Roger), which we teach as a Pedal Screen, as well as a Quick Running Back Screen (Salt/Pepper).

These Quick Screens were utilized by all 4 levels of our youth program (8U, 10U, 12U, 14U), as well as our High School squad at a very high rate.

Welcome to the Quarterback Decision Making Training Online Course. Most football coaches weren't taught how to train quarterback decision making, so we created a simple systematic program that helps coaches create a repetitive pre-snap to the next snap process for their Quarterbacks to step through every play. This eliminates mistakes, allows your QBs to play fast so your team can score more points and win.

Once you complete this course you will:

- Have a repeatable process your QBs will step through every play
- Simplify your Pre-snap Keys to ensure your are not overloading your QBs mind 
- Simplify your Post-snap progressions so they are making decisions systematically, not on the fly
- Have concise talking points to focus on during hectic games
