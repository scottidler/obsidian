## Description
The ROLL TACKLE RING is a foam filled ring! It rolls easily without tipping. Give tacklers a moving target. Takes the head out of tackling. Promotes “heads-up” tackling. Makes shoulder leverage tackling a habit. Use it to teach the concept of “eyes through the thighs!” Teach a tackler to shoot his arms, wrap up and squeeze! And finish the tackle by rolling the ball carrier over to the ground. Leg drive and upper body shoulder leverage is needed to bring the Roll Tackle Ring to the ground. Use it to teach DB’s to track the movement of a ball carrier while keeping a balanced and “gathered” stance. Ideal for teaching LB’s angle tackling! Let it
represent a defender and RB’s can practice throwing cut blocks against it. Can be used without a helmet or shoulder pads! Use it to “form up” a tackle in walk though drills or in full speed hitting drills. Perfect for off-season conditioning!
Available in three sizes & three colors - Red, Yellow or Blue!
