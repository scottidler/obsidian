## Description
Stretch or outside zone in the spread offense is an incredibly versatile play. It allows you to get the edge but also gives great vertical running lanes if the defense over pursues. You can also use the blocking scheme for jet sweep, QB sprint out, etc.  You need outside zone in your arsenal.
