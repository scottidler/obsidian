# How To Run The Flood Concept

<iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iOyBuux6DNA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Description
This video breaks down the flood concept and all the different ways you can run it in your offense. As long as you have the main components to the route, you can really run this any way you'd like. 

Any NFL game you see will include this concept a handful of times on either drop back, play action, or boot pass. You'll also see this from multiple formations, with jet sweeps attached, strong and weak floods. 

Hopefully after watching this, the next time you see a flood concept on Sundays you'll know exactly what the play is and how the QB should be reading it!
