The spacing concept is a very simple concept that can be implemented into your offense. It has a very clean progression across the field and works well vs zone coverage as you're getting 4-5 underneath WRs finding space. 

The version shown in this clip is a combination of spacing and the lion concept (double slants). The double slants are great vs a 2-high look. If we get a single high look, you'd want to convert that into a slant flat to put the flat defender in a bind. 

Notice how the OC for the Eagles puts his 2 best WRs up top with a heavy run look on the bottom, creating a really great situation. This gives the option for deep concepts while forcing a 1v1 somewhere while being able to run anything they want to the TE side.
