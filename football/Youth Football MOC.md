# Youth Football MOC


[[Offense]]

## What I to avoid
- Talk about football 
- Not have to change our offense after the first game
- Not be rah-rah, trying to motivate our kids
- Not be out of gas in the second half of the game
- Not be disorganized
- Not take forever to figure out what kids we have and how to use them
- Be poor at tackling
- Be poor at blocking
- Have behavioral problems (especially on the sideline during a game)
- Be unprepared for special teams
- Complain about officiating or specific calls
- Have our players reflect poorly on Cleveland or the team
- Having kids standing around; they should be exhausted by the end of every practice

## What I want to do
- Practice `BLOCKING` and `TACKLING` everyday 
- We run everywhere we go; on and off the field; to water; back, etc
- Be a physically fit and prepared team
- We need both. If they aren't focused we will just work on our fitness
- Develop toughness and aggressiveness on our team (know the difference between `hurt` and `injured`)
- Take advantage of 2-3 (maybe more) very special athletes we have on our team
- Use motion, especially moving across the formation to confuse the defense
- Run the same plays out of 3 primary formations to make it easier on us and difficult on the defense
- use the 4-2-5 defense (different from my 5-3) to match the HS and bring pressure with 5 and 6 man blitzes
- Have WRs wear wrist bands too (probably need 10 for them alone)
- Use visual system to make it easy on `Q` and offense to know what they are doing
- Have a distinct depth chart (at least 2 deep at important positions)
- Have a substitution plan where we put no more that 1-2 `10-play` players on the field at the same time
- Have a plan to try to get all of their `10-plays` satisfied _before_ the 4th quarter
- Use our large coaching staff to improve these players so they _aren't_ `10-play` players
- Install the Defense and Offense early so that we can just *rep it over and over*
- Run drills that help us achieve what we are trying to do on offense and defense
- Have a captain of the 6 in the "box"; probably the Mike
	- N
	- T
	- DEs
	- S
	- M
- Have a captain of the secondary; probably the Safety
	- W
	- R
	- Cs
	- F
- 2 kinds of Dad coaches
	- We only have one kind
- Get contact information and team comms setup ASAP

### Do you reward what you value
- Dirty shirt award: works hardest at practice

### Coaching Philosophy

1. **Core Values:**
    - Toughness
    - Competitiveness
    - Unrelenting work ethic
    - Discipline
    - Short memory
    - Supportive teamwork
    - Being prepared, on time, and present
    - No negativity
2. **Definition of Success:**
    - Top physical shape
    - Prepared mentally (knowing plays, assignments)
    - Aggressive competitiveness to win
3. **Balancing Winning and Player Development:**
    - Competition to win and succeed will drive us; but not at _any_ cost
4. **Discipline and Adherence to Team Rules:**
    - Need to be in top physical shape
    - Players too distracted to pay attention can focus on improving their physical fitness and strength
5. **Fostering Teamwork and Sportsmanship:**
    - Lead by example
    - Shun negativity, praise correct actions and full effort

### Practice Structure

1. **Practice Frequency and Duration:**
    - 3 days a week, 2 hours each
    - One 1.5-hour team meeting
2. **Conditioning Incorporation:**
    - Stretching routine led by players every time
    - Running to different locations (water breaks, moving to new exercises)

### Player Expectations

1. **Specific Behaviors:**
    - Players focused and ready to learn
    - No talking and goofing around
2. **Communication of Expectations:**
    - Team meeting with parents at the beginning of the season
    - Coaches will not discuss position or playing time with parents
    - Players must initiate conversations about these topics outside of practice or game days; meetings can be requested
3. **Role of Team Captains:**
    - Only the captain on the field can talk to the referee (similar to rugby)
    - We DO NOT complain about reffing

### Expectations of Coaching Staff

1. **Roles and Responsibilities:**
    - Head coach will call the game offense, defense, and special teams.
    - Assistant Coach will look for weaknesses of the opposition's offense and communicate them to the play caller (head coach)
    - Another coach will handle video and film editing and breakdown.
    - Other coaches will observe the opposing team's plays, formations, and players to identify weaknesses to exploit.
    - Philip could flim the game from the sideline.
2. **Alignment with Coaching Philosophy:**
    - Meetings before the season to set expectations.
    - Coaches should not disagree or argue in front of the kids; 
    - Parent conversations should occur before or after practice, never on game day.
    - Weekly coach's meetings to discuss plans for the week.
3. **Professional Development:**
    - I will provide YouTube videos for the coaching staff to watch as part of their training.
4. Bring to practice
	1. whistle
	2. stop watch
	3. notebook & pencil

### Game Strategy

1. **Offense and Defense Approach:**
    - **Offense:**
        - Get playmakers the ball in space
        - Use play action and deception
        - Use counterflow
    - **Defense:**
        - Contain via boxing DEs (turn everything back towards the middle of the field)
        - Confuse the offense, Blitz
2. **In-Game Substitutions:**
    - Players are required to have a minimum of 10 plays per game, with some special teams plays counting towards this.
        - Kick Off / Kick Return
        - Punt / Punt Return
    - No more than 1-2 players with only 10 plays on the field at once.
    - Certain positions will be off-limits for these players due to vulnerabilities.
    - A coach will be responsible for managing substitutions.
3. **Special Teams Strategy:**
    - Field goals will not be attempted unless a good kicker and capable OL are present.
    - Punts will be rugby-style.
    - Special teams formations for kickoff, kick return, punt, and punt return will be used as part of conditioning.

### Player Development

1. **Assessing and Tracking Progress:**
    - Weigh and measure every kid at the beginning of the season
    - Test speed and agility
    - Recover ability off the ground
    - Track data via a spreadsheet to inform deployment of talent on the field
2. **Team Captains' Role:**
    - Given a lot of responsibility and expectations
    - Lead by example
3. **Position-Specific Training:**
    - Identify the skills needed for the offense and defense being run
    - Build drills to improve specific areas
    - Use drills only to fix needs; replace drills once needs are addressed

### Team Culture

1. **Values and Behaviors:**
    - Run everywhere, on and off the field
2. **Traditions and Rituals:**
    - Clap chant about the school to practice unity, coordination, and esprit de corps
    - Aim to build a team of athletes that never give up
3. **Recognizing and Rewarding Positive Behavior:**
    - On-the-spot call outs from all coaches
    - Team closing meeting to discuss achievements

### Communication with Players and Parents

1. **Keeping Parents Informed:**
    - Beginning of the year meeting where expectations are set
    - Email and chatting apps (text, snap, or something similar)
2. **Handling Playing Time Concerns or Questions from Parents:**
    - Coaches will not have these conversations with parents.
    - Players can lead these conversations before or after practice or ask for a meeting with a coach, never on game day.

### Game Day Management

1. **Roles and Responsibilities:**
    - Head coach will call the offense and occasionally the defense, as well as choose special teams.
    - Defensive Coordinator will call and coach the defense unless the head coach requests something specific.
    - Another coach will handle video and film editing and breakdown.
    - Other coaches will observe the opposing team's plays, formations, and players to identify weaknesses to exploit.
2. **Post-Game Analysis and Feedback:**
    - Quick postgame synopsis by the head coach immediately after the game.
    - Detailed breakdown on the first day back to practice the following week, with the help of another coach for film analysis.
