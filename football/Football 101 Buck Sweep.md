# Football 101 Buck Sweep - YouTube

<iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZtlGCGJGE64" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Description
The Buck sweep originated with the Wing-T offense. Recently, more and more teams are sprinkling it into their playbooks out of a number of formations. It entails both offensive guards pulling and leading to one side of the formation. The scheme can wall off defenses and help get the offense outside.
