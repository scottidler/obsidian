# Attaching Steel Legs to Walnut Table

- Use screws up to **1 1/2 inches** long for attaching steel legs to avoid penetrating the surface of your **1 3/4 inch** thick walnut table.
- Place screws **3/4 to 1 inch** away from the edges to prevent splitting, especially when drilling pilot holes.
- Avoid placing screws directly in or near the areas where the planks are joined with biscuits and glue.
- Position screws at least **1 inch** away from glued joints to maintain structural integrity.
