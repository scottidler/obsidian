# arroparse vs enrollarse

"Arroparse" and "enrollarse" are two Spanish verbs that describe different actions:

1. **Arroparse**: This verb means "to wrap oneself up" or "to cover oneself," especially with a blanket or warm clothing. It's often used in the context of keeping oneself warm. For example, on a cold night, you might "arroparse" with a thick blanket. It's about seeking comfort and warmth by covering oneself.
    
2. **Enrollarse**: This verb has a couple of different meanings depending on the context:
    
    - Literally, it can mean "to roll up" or "to wrap up" something into a roll. For example, you might "enrollar" a poster or a yoga mat.
    - Colloquially, in Spain, "enrollarse" can also mean to talk at length, often in a way that's perceived as unnecessary or excessive. It's akin to the English "to ramble on."
    - Additionally, it can colloquially mean to have a romantic or sexual encounter, similar to the English slang "hook up."

So, while "arroparse" is specifically about covering oneself for warmth, "enrollarse" can mean physically rolling something up or, in conversational terms, either speaking excessively or engaging in a romantic or casual relationship.
