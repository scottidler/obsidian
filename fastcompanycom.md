## Description
The article discusses the factors that led to Red Lobster's bankruptcy, particularly focusing on the role of private equity. Private equity firms acquired Red Lobster with the aim of leveraging its real estate assets and improving efficiency. However, these efforts ultimately backfired, resulting in declining sales and an over-reliance on discounts and promotions. The article delves into the impact of shifting consumer preferences, competition, and mismanagement on Red Lobster's demise. It also explores the challenges faced by traditional casual dining chains in adapting to newer trends in the restaurant industry.
