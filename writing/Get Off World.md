# Get Off World

Crouched low, he labored to control his breathing. In and out trying to stay quiet while peering around the condenser. He could not see where the sentry went. The opaque greenhouse material made it impossible to see through them. Only if a body was up against it would he be able to see the outline of the shadow cast.

Getting caught again would not only mean severe punishment for him but also his creche mates.He quickly pushed that out of his mind. He needed to be present, hyper aware. A sentry could pick up elevated heart rate, sharp breaths not to mention any rustling or footfalls. The sentries were programmed to pursue and capture any rodent or runaway and either exterminate or drag to the farm supervisor. "I can't get caught this time...", he thought to himself.

This room was a small antechamber to a much larger grow tent. This had all of the seeds and fertilizer equipment, several of which blinked and showed glowing readouts of their status. He used this low light to move to the vestibule opening.

Just then he heard the familiar sound of the sentry approaching. He ducked back into the shadows wedged between two hydroponic enhancers. The large cables powering them snaked along the ground and tripped him as he hurriedly retreated into the shadows. He fell on his ass and rolled backward into the tent material. It stretched and bulged but eventually stopped his progress.

At that moment the reticulated arm of the sentry pulled back the hanging opening to the vestibule. A solid blue column of light shot through the opening and played on the opposite wall and machinery. Slowly the sentry pushed its body into the room. It had heard the noise. As it let go of the hanging material of the opening it hovered in the center of the room and was slowing rotating with with its cone of light that severed as its ability to scan for irregularities.
The dark are where he hid was lit up with the bouncing light. As the sentry approached he thought he caught for sure.

A scrabbling sound and a flash of something darting through the door from which he came got the sentry to spin and follow in quick pursuit. That rat or possum or cat was taking one for the team.

"Oh for fucks sake!" he whispered under his breath once the sound of the pursuit became muffled and distant. He peeled himself off the tent wall and back into a crouching position. Then he quickly made his way across the dirt floor covered in power and data cables to the door the sentry came through.

The room opened up into a giant tent several football field long and at least one wide, if not more. Row after row of corn, 6 ft tall, laid out in perfect rows filled the volume. Above was a systems of pipes and cables to provide water and artificial light. He hate this place. This is where he and the others worked every day, tending to the crops.

Through the middle of the tent was an 8 ft wide path straight to the other end where the center of the farm complex lay situated. Going down the middle was the quietest and most direct path, but it was also the most exposed as the lighting along the path was well lit by the lights overhead even when the grow lights were low as they were now.

He decided to chance it. Every second he was away from the creche was a greater chance of being discovered unaccounted for. He was in a crouched lopping shuffled trying to make it to the other side as fast as possible. A sentry would detect him immediately if it shone its cone in his direction now.

With only about a third of the way to go, he saw a shadow appear behind the fabric of the door he was fast approaching. Without thinking he dove to the side into one of the furrows between the rows of corn. He was sure he was seen, but continued to move quickly down the row and away from the light of the path. Every few steps he would brush against a stalk or leaf that would make a noise that sounded his presence. No way was a sentry not going to find him.

Just then the light streaming down the row was blocked out by a body. The shadows cast were long and spindly. It was huge. The lights were being occluded by an overseer.

He sat there stunned some 50 ft from the oncoming shadow. No way would he survive being caught by an overseer. The only good news is that their sight was not nearly as good as a sentry. He had a chance but he needed to get out of this row and separate himself from this overseer.

He carefully squeezed between cornstalks, 2 rows, 4, then 7. He accidentally stepped on fall stalk and husk which made a very loud rustle. The overseer screamed and started crashing through the rows in his direction. "Fuck this", he thought and began running parallel to the path towards the door.

Had he cut himself? He felt wet all over and it took several moments to realize the irrigation systems were showering down water on the plants in this sector. That was great news, since the sound of water hitting the plants would greatly confuse the senses of the overseer.
