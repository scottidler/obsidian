## Description
Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by progressive weakness and impaired sensory function in the arms and legs. It is considered a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the peripheral nerves and nerve roots. CIDP can result in significant disability if left untreated, but early diagnosis and appropriate management can improve outcomes for patients. Symptoms may include tingling or numbness in the extremities, muscle weakness, and difficulties with coordination. Treatment typically involves corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or immunosuppressive medications. Ongoing medical monitoring and therapy adjustments are necessary to manage CIDP effectively.
