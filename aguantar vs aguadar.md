    - Meaning: "Aguantar" means "to endure," "to tolerate," or "to withstand" in Spanish. It is used to describe the ability to bear or put up with something, whether it's physical discomfort, a difficult situation, or someone's behavior.
    - Example: "Tuve que aguantar el dolor durante toda la carrera." (I had to endure the pain throughout the race.)
2. "Aguadar" (Spanish verb):
    
    - Meaning: "Aguadar" means "to wait for" or "to hold off" in Spanish. It is used when you are waiting for something to happen or when you delay an action because you're waiting for a specific moment or condition.
