# 7 Plots

Often, the aim of narrative theory is to identify common plots that are used in many stories. One of the most well-known attempts in recent years is Christopher Booker’s 2004 book [_The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories_](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/114823.The_Seven_Basic_Plots).

In this book, Booker proposes that any story will follow one of seven different plots:

1. [[Overcoming the Monster]]. The protagonist must defeat an antagonist (usually an individual, force, or entity) that threatens them and the wider world.
2. [[Rags to Riches]]. The protagonist achieves something they lack, loses what they’ve gained, and then gets it back again.
3. [[The Quest]]. The protagonist must set out in pursuit of a treasure, place, or other goal, overcoming challenges along the way.
4. [[Voyage and Return]]. The protagonist travels to a strange new place, experiences hardships and makes discoveries, and then returns home with the lessons they have learned.
5. [[Comedy]]. The protagonist experiences a series of lighthearted or confusing events, before the story resolves into a happy ending.
6. [[Tragedy]]. The protagonist has a central trait or flaw or makes a mistake, which results in catastrophe.
7. [[Rebirth]]. The protagonist undergoes a transformation, and often ends up a better person as a result.

Understanding these archetypal plots can be helpful when [editing creative writing](https://knowadays.com/courses/becoming-an-editor/editing-creative-writing/), as it will help you identify common plot tropes and assess how well they have been used. 

In the rest of this post, we’ll look at Booker’s basic plots in more detail.
